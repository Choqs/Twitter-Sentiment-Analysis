# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The aim of the project is to classify between -3 & 3 the negativity / positivity of a tweet. Using a large dataset of 50k samples labeled between -1 & 1, we train a model for a transfer learning. With only 1k samples of labeled data between -3 & 3, we achieve a descent accuracy.
